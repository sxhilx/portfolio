# About This Project


I created this personal portfolio website when I was still fairly new to web development, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (i tried my best at that time to make it responsive). Since then, I've learned a lot and am currently learning different JavaScript libraries. I am keeping this repo as a reminder of how far I've come and as a source of motivation. If anyone ever stumble accross this do check out my latest portfolio.
